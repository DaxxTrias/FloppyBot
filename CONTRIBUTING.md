# How to contribute

Let's keep it short and simple: If you would like to contribute to FloppyBot, please keep the following things in mind:

- Submit a Pull Request through GitHub with your changes.
- Your changes must pass all tests successfully.
- If you added a new feature, tests are expected.
- Code style and formatting is enforced using `csharpier` and `stylecop`. Unless the task or PR is specifically about
  modifying settings of these tools, do not change the behaviour.

And lastly: Remember that this is still a hobby project so keep expectations reasonable.
